## Fair Source

This is the repo for [fair.io](https://fair.io/).


### Governance and Process

Fair Source is just getting started, so our governance and process are fairly
lightweight. [Chad Whitacre](https://github.com/chadwhitacre) (Sentry) and
[Zeke Gabrielse](https://github.com/ezekg) (Keygen) are handling new
[company](https://github.com/fairsource/fair.io/issues/new?template=company.yaml)
and
[license](https://github.com/fairsource/fair.io/issues/new?template=license.yaml)
submissions.

For **companies**, we are looking for a) a blog post announcement about b) a
software product using a [Fair Source license](https://fair.io/licenses/). If
you're using BUSL we will need to review your license more closely since BUSL
can have highly variable implementations.

For **licenses**, we're still working out specifics but we intend to be fairly
stringent in order to avoid license proliferation. Uour license must meet the
[Fair Source Definition](https://fair.io/about/), and it should be adopted at
more than one company, at least.
