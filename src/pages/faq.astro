                Fair Source is an alternative to closed source, allowing you to
                safely share access to your company's core software products.
                The two basic features of Fair Source <a href="/licenses/">licensing</a

              The basic steps to adopting Fair Source are to plan for community

              With minimal restrictions to protect the producer's business
              model, developers can read, use, modify, and redistribute Fair
              Source Software. Developers can propose modifications back to the
              producer if they wish, or simply benefit from the company's
              continual investment in maintenance and improvement. In the event
              a Fair Source product is abandoned or developed in an
              unsatisfactory direction, developers can fork a previous version.

              Yes. Fair Source <a href="/licenses/">licenses</a> are written
              such that it is difficult to violate them. If Fair Source
              Software includes feature restrictions based on certain criteria,
              the burden is on the software to monitor and enforce the
              criteria, not the user of the software.
