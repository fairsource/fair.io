## Fair Source

This is the repo for [fair.io](https://fair.io/).


### Governance and Process

Fair Source is just getting started, so our governance and process are fairly
lightweight. [Chad Whitacre](https://github.com/chadwhitacre) (Sentry) and
[Zeke Gabrielse](https://github.com/ezekg) (Keygen) are handling new
[company](https://github.com/fairsource/fair.io/issues/new?template=company.yaml)
and
[license](https://github.com/fairsource/fair.io/issues/new?template=license.yaml)
submissions. [David Cramer](https://github.com/dcramer) is the founder of Fair
Source; he sets the high-level direction and intent.

For **companies**, we are looking for a) a blog post announcement about b) a
software product using a [Fair Source license](https://fair.io/licenses/). If
you're using BUSL we will need to review your license more closely since BUSL
can have highly variable implementations.

For **licenses**, we're still working out specifics but we intend to be fairly
stringent in order to avoid license proliferation. Of course your license must
meet the [Fair Source Definition](https://fair.io/about/). It must also not put
an undue burden on the user to monitor their compliance with your license (any
compliance checks should be built into your software itself). It should also be
adopted at more than one company, at least.
